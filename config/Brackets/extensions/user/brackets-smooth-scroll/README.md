brackets-smooth-scroll
============================

Adds kinetic smooth scrolling (like MacOS, iOS and Android) to Brackets for devices and/or operating systems that don't support it natively.

## Notes

Only tested in sprint 34. If it works for you on an earlier version, please let me know so I can update the package.json file accordingly.

As of now, the scroll parameters are still hard coded and work well on my linux desktop with a microsoft optical mouse and on my linux laptop. If you need different parameters, it should be fairly straightforward to edit them in the main.js file. In the future, if there is enough interest I can add some menu options or some gui to change the scroll parameters (contributions are very welcome :D)
