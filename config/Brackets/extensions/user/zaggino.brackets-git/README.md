# Brackets-Git

Git extension for [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

Should work on all Brackets platforms (Win, Mac, Linux).

You need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

Windows users need to have [msysgit](https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) installed.

Mac users need to have [Git for OS X](https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/) installed.

## Installation

You can use Brackets built-in [extension registry](https://brackets-registry.aboutweb.com/).

Extension can be configured in "File > Git Settings..." (this window will show the first time after you install the extension).

### Pushing to username/password protected remote repositories

Currently possible only if credentials helper like [Windows Credential Store for Git](http://gitcredentialstore.codeplex.com/) is installed.

You'll need to push manually for the first time to setup your username/password into credentials helper.
