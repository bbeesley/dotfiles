## Opening issues

Before opening a new issue, please be sure to check out list of already open issues [here](https://github.com/zaggino/brackets-git/issues?state=open) so we can prevent having duplicates. Extension is mainly developed in Windows version of Brackets but should work on Mac and Linux too. Fixing OS specific errors if they appear might take more time though.

Always try to get as much relevant information from Brackets console (F12) as possible.
