SASS Formatting
---

You need to supply an absolute path to the sass-convert executble for SASS formatting to work.

+ Install [SASS Installation website](http://sass-lang.com/install)
+ Get absolute path to executable

On MacOSX you can go into terminal and type ```which sass-convert```

Since I use rbenv for manageing Ruby versions it gave me this.
```/Users/drewh/.rbenv/shims/sass-convert```

+ Now go open Brackets and go to ```Debug > Open Preferences File```


It will look something like this.


	{
	    "useTabChar": false,
	    "tabSize": 2,
	    "spaceUnits": 2,
	    "closeBrackets": true,
	    "showLineNumbers": true,
	    "styleActiveLine": false,
	    "wordWrap": false,
	    "linting.enabled": true,
	    "linting.collapsed": false,
	    "quickview.enabled": true
	}


Now add ```"beautify.sassConvertPath": "/Users/drewh/.rbenv/shims/sass-convert"``` at the bottom.  Change the path name to the path all the way to executable.

You will now be able to format scss files.
